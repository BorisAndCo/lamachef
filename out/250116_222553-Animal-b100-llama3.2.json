  "description": "Luminaris luxurians, a newly discovered species of bioluminescent insect found in the depths of the Amazon rainforest. The Luminaris has an elongated body, approximately 5 cm in length, with iridescent wings and a distinctive, shimmering abdomen that reflects light and emits a soft blue-green glow. Its unique ability to produce light allows it to attract prey and communicate with other members of its species in the dark, humid environment of the rainforest floor."
