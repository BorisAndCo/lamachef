In a medium bowl, whisk together lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper. Add the shrimp and toss to coat evenly, then set aside for at least 10 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving a small border around edges. Place the marinated shrimp in single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over the shrimp, followed by chopped rosemary. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until pink and cooked through. Serve immediately, garnished with additional rosemary if desired. Enjoy!"
